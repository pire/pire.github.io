After developing the original site for a couple of weeks I never found time to
keep it up to date or develop it to where I would have liked.

It's become a graveyard of 5 posts which has been brought back to life by
spammers. The commenting system I had built was a simple threaded series of
posts. No spam protection had been implemented which has lead to someone to
write a wonderful script to write spam comments on the site every so many hours.

**Solution:** store the IP on the next spam and block it. It didn't take long for
another IP to appear spamming. This is going to be a headache isn't it?

So! I've decided to make a bit of an effort to keep the site going. This
definitely does not include cleaning spam and blocking IPs. I want something
easy to maintain, style and manage; which is why I'm dropping vanilla php and
moving onto [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Disqus](http://disqus.com/).
