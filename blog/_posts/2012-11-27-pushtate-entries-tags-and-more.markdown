Some more goodies for the site.

  * pushstate+ajax are here! yay! pages load faster than ever now!
  * entries now also have tags, although that's just hidden away in the backend atm
  * Secret admin area so I can create entries instead of using mysql

So hopefully with a bit of a CMS I'll be more prone to adding content... We shall see!
