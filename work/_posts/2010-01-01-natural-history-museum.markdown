The Natural History Museum asked us to build an [interactive key](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/british-natural-history/urban-tree-survey/take-part/cherry-survey/identify-cherries/cherries-key/index.html) which posed a series of questions in order to identify your cherry tree. We chose to ditch Flash so that the key would also be accessible on mobile devices and made use of [the amazing Jit](http://philogb.github.com/jit/) to build a truly engaging experience.
