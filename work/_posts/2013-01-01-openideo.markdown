> A Web-based platform for innovation where designers and other creative thinkers create better, together.

I've worked as the core front-end developer on [openIDEO](http://openideo.com) since it's inception back in 2010. It's a constantly evolving platform with a sleek, crisp design which even looks good in IE7, bespoke admin interface and a number of custom javascript widgets.
