> Possum is committed to improving the quality of life of disabled and elderly people by providing innovative technology solutions and support services; enabling empowerment and independence.

I developed a custom CMS for [Possum](http://www.possum.co.uk/) to be able to manage their website and products, events and news. As they deal with assistive technology I used open web standards to ensure the site was accessible, including special consideration to visually impaired users.
